# CI/CD Pipeline Setup with Jenkins and Docker

This repository demonstrates a simple Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying an application.

---

## Features
- Automated code build and test on each commit.
- Docker image creation and deployment to DockerHub.
- Easy-to-extend Jenkins pipeline.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Jenkins** installed on your system or a cloud-based Jenkins instance.
2. **Docker** installed on the Jenkins server and the local machine.
3. A **GitHub Repository** with project source code.
4. **DockerHub account** for image storage.

## Jenkinsfile
The `Jenkinsfile` is the blueprint of the pipeline and includes the following stages:
1. **Checkout Code**: Pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Build**: Installs dependencies for the application.
3. **Test**: Runs test cases to ensure code quality.
4. **Docker Build**: Creates a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
5. **Docker Push**: Pushes the built Docker image to DockerHub.

---

## Steps to Set Up
### 1. Install Jenkins and Plugins
- Install Jenkins locally or on a cloud instance.
- Install the following Jenkins plugins:
  - **Pipeline**
  - **Git**
  - **Docker Pipeline**

### 2. Add Jenkinsfile
- Add the provided `Jenkinsfile` to the root of your project repository.
- Commit and push the file to your GitHub repository:
  ```bash
  git add Jenkinsfile
  git commit -m "Add Jenkinsfile"
  git push origin main
  ```

### 3. Create a Dockerfile
- Add a `Dockerfile` to define how the application is built into a Docker image. Example:
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM node:18
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package.json .
  RUN npm install
  COPY . .
  EXPOSE 3000
  CMD ["npm", "start"]
  ```

### 4. Configure Jenkins
- Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins.
- Link your GitHub repository to the Jenkins job.
- Set up DockerHub credentials in Jenkins:
  1. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials".
  2. Add DockerHub username and password (use `docker-hub-credentials` as ID).

### 5. Test the Pipeline
- Push a code change to your repository.
- The Jenkins pipeline will execute automatically, and the Docker image will be built and pushed to DockerHub.

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Push changes to trigger the Jenkins pipeline:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Code updates"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Check the Jenkins dashboard for pipeline status.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Docker not accessible from Jenkins**: Ensure the Jenkins user has Docker permissions by running:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
  ```
- **Pipeline failure**: Check the console output in Jenkins for detailed logs.
